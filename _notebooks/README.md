# Auto-convert Jupyter Notebooks To Posts

[`fastpages`](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages) will automatically convert the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) Notebooks saved into this directory as blog posts!

Notebooks follow the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-*.ipynb`.  Examples of valid filenames are:

```shell

2020-02-01-Welcome-my-first-blogpost.ipynb
2021-02-08-Fast-Sneaker.ipynb

```
